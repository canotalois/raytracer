# Raytracer - 3D Scene Renderer Configuration Program

## Overview
This project is a 3D scene rendering program that allows users to define and render 3D environments through a configuration file. Users can customize camera settings, shapes, materials, and lighting to create visually compelling scenes.

## Features
- **Camera Configuration**: Set up the camera's aspect ratio, field of view, and position.
- **Renderer Settings**: Configure background colors, anti-aliasing, and recursion depths for advanced visual effects.
- **Materials**: Define material properties like color and reflectivity for realistic rendering.
- **Geometric Shapes**: Build scenes with planes, spheres, cylinders, and more.
- **Lighting**: Add dynamic lighting to enhance realism.
- **Transformations**: Apply translation, rotation, and scaling to objects.

## Usage
1. Edit the configuration file to define your scene.
2. Run the program to render the scene.
3. Adjust settings as needed to refine the output.
